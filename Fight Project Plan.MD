Project Overview
Project Background
Fight is a 3D multiplayer shooter game designed to deliver an immersive and competitive gaming experience. Players engage in dynamic battles across procedurally generated maps, utilizing intuitive controls that are optimized for both mobile and desktop platforms. The game’s foundation lies in its ability to provide fast-paced gameplay, real-time multiplayer synchronization, and engaging competitive features, making it a strong candidate for a WEB3 transformation.
The Fight project aims to elevate this gaming experience into a blockchain game by integrating Solana blockchain technology and issuing the Fight (FIGHT) token, with 100% of the token supply launched through the PUMP.fun platform. Solana’s high throughput (thousands of transactions per second) and low fees (approximately 0.00025 SOL per transaction) make it an ideal choice for GameFi development (Solana, 2025). PUMP.fun, a prominent token launch platform in the Solana ecosystem, has facilitated over 6 million token projects by May 2025, providing Fight with a rapid deployment opportunity (PUMP.fun Data, 2025).
Core Vision and Objectives
Fight’s vision is to create a GameFi ecosystem that blends the excitement of 3D shooter games with WEB3 innovation, delivering the following value propositions:
Asset Ownership: Empower players with true ownership of in-game assets (e.g., weapons, character skins) via NFTs.
Economic Incentives: Enable players to earn FIGHT tokens through Play-to-Earn mechanics.
Community-Driven Governance: Foster player participation in game decisions via a DAO, enhancing engagement.
Sustainable Ecosystem: Maintain long-term token economic stability through a buyback-and-burn mechanism.
Specific objectives include:
Q2 2025: Launch FIGHT token, integrate basic NFT functionality, and initiate community building.
Q4 2025: Release Fight’s first version, host global shooting tournaments, and attract players and investors.
2026 and Beyond: Implement DAO governance, explore cross-chain compatibility, and expand game features.

With its vibrant 3D visuals and engaging sound design, Fight is ideal for quick, multi-round matches, averaging 3-5 minutes per session. These attributes make it a strong foundation for blockchain integration.
Fight Blockchain Integration
Fight will incorporate the following WEB3 features via Solana:
NFT System: Create NFTs for in-game items (e.g., weapons, character skins, special props), enabling ownership, trading, or display.
Token Economy: Use FIGHT tokens for in-game purchases, tournament entry fees, staking rewards, and governance voting.
Play-to-Earn Mechanics: Players earn FIGHT tokens by completing tasks, winning matches, or participating in events.
Decentralized Marketplace: Enable players to trade NFTs and FIGHT tokens on the Fight platform.
DAO Governance: Allow FIGHT holders to vote on game updates, event planning, or economic adjustments via a DAO.
These features draw inspiration from Axie Infinity’s NFT pet system and Decentraland’s DAO governance, aiming to boost player engagement and economic incentives (DappRadar, 2024; Decentraland, 2024).
New Features and Upgrades
Fight will introduce the following enhancements:
NFT Weapons and Skins: Players can own unique NFT weapons and skins, such as “Thunder Sniper” or “Cyberpunk Skin,” tradable in-game or on marketplaces.
Tournament System: Host regular global shooting tournaments where players pay FIGHT as entry fees, with winners earning substantial FIGHT or rare NFTs.
Social Features: Add friend lists, voice chat, and squad systems to enhance player interaction.
Cross-Platform Support: Optimize for PC, iOS, and Android to broaden the audience.

These additions are inspired by Valorant’s competitive modes and Axie Infinity’s NFT trading model, designed to increase player retention and economic activity (DappRadar, 2024).
Token Economics
Token Overview
Name: Fight
Symbol: FIGHT
Total Supply: 1 billion FIGHT
Blockchain: Solana
Launch Platform: PUMP.fun (100% token supply issued via PUMP.fun)
Economic Model and Buyback Mechanism
Fight’s token economic model balances deflation and incentives, drawing from PancakeSwap’s buyback-and-burn mechanism (PancakeSwap, 2024):
Buyback and Burn: 10% of in-game transaction fees (e.g., NFT purchases, tournament entries) are used to buy back and burn FIGHT tokens, reducing circulating supply and potentially increasing token value. Community rewards are provided entirely through this buyback mechanism, ensuring players earn FIGHT via gameplay and tournaments.
Staking Rewards: Players can stake FIGHT to earn an annual percentage yield (APR), initially set at 5-10%, adjustable based on market conditions.
Inflation Control: Balance token supply and demand through buyback-and-burn and limited reward issuance.
Governance Incentives: FIGHT holders participating in DAO voting receive additional rewards, encouraging long-term holding.
Token Uses:
In-Game Purchases: Players use FIGHT to buy weapons, skins, or other virtual items.
Tournament Entry Fees: Players pay FIGHT to join high-stake tournaments.
Staking Rewards: Staking FIGHT yields additional tokens or rare NFTs.
Governance Voting: FIGHT holders vote on game decisions via the DAO.
Economic Sustainability: The buyback-and-burn mechanism ensures token value stability while incentivizing player participation in gameplay and community activities. This model simplifies Axie Infinity’s dual-token system (AXS and SLP) into a single-token system to reduce complexity (DappRadar, 2024).
